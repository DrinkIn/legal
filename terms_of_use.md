By accessing this web site, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Use, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this web site are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.

###Copyright
All content in this site, including but not limited to text, graphics or code is copyrighted as a collective work under the United States and other copyright laws, and is the property of DrinkIn. This includes works that are licensed to DrinkIn, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Permission is granted to electronically copy and print hard copy portions of this site for the sole purpose of placing an order with DrinkIn.

You further agree not to change or delete any proprietary notices from materials downloaded from the site.

###Disclaimer
The materials on DrinkIn's web site are provided "as is". DrinkIn makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, DrinkIn does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its Internet web site or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

###Limitations
In no event shall DrinkIn or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on DrinkIn's Internet site, even if DrinkIn or a DrinkIn authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

###Revisions and Errata
The materials appearing on DrinkIn's web site could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. DrinkIn does not warrant that any of the materials on its web site are accurate, complete, or current. DrinkIn may make changes to the materials contained on its web site at any time without notice. DrinkIn does not, however, make any commitment to update the materials.

###Links
DrinkIn has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its Internet web site and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by DrinkIn of the site. Use of any such linked web site is at the user's own risk.

###Store Pages
DrinkIn partners with stores to showcase their products through pages that users may access within our site. DrinkIn uses various services from third parties to allow transactions to occur between you and these partner stores. When using our store pages, you are purchasing goods from such stores through the system that DrinkIn has developed along with these third-party services. Any actions DrinkIn may take relating to the fulfillment of such transactions are on behalf of a partner store and do not imply, in any way, that you are purchasing goods from DrinkIn.

###Delivery Policies
By ordering through us, and from our partner liquor stores, you are representing that you are 21 years of age or older and that you will be the person receiving any delivery. Your signature will be required upon delivery. DrinkIn personnel will also require a Government-issued photo ID for age verification before making the delivery. DrinkIn personnel may also ask for additional identification, may ask you questions regarding such identification, and may ask for the credit card used to purchase the goods. Any other persons present during the delivery process may also have to show valid government issued ID for age verification. DrinkIn personnel have every right to refuse delivering goods to individuals without reason.
As a security measure, you agree to allow DrinkIn personnel to take a digital picture of your ID, whether or not a delivery is fulfilled. From time to time, DrinkIn personnel may also have video-capturing hardware with them during deliveries. You agree, by using this site, to allow DrinkIn to use such devices during deliveries for strategic and operational purposes. DrinkIn will not use such footage for marketing or promotional purposes without your prior written consent.

Orders placed with DrinkIn are expected to arrive within a few hours of delivery, though we make every effort to fulfill your order sooner. Orders are transported using company-owned, leased, rented, or authorized vehicles and by DrinkIn personnel acting, as a whole, as contractors for partner liquor stores.

Title to, and ownership of, any goods you order passes from our partner stores to you as soon as it leaves their doors; it is up to you to know the relevant laws in your state. DrinkIn abides by current Massachusetts General Laws regarding transportation of alcohol and is limited to deliver up to eight (8) gallons alcohol per purchase and on days and times in which alcohol purchases are lawfully allowed.

###Returns and Refund Policy
If you are unhappy with our Service, for any reason, please contact us by phone, via email, or through Twitter. All returns or refund requests must be initiated within a day of the delivery date. If you suspect a delivered product is spoiled, please do not dispose of the liquid, as we can only take back products that have not been imbibed.

If we sent you the wrong product, please contact us immediately and we will arrange a new delivery and pickup of the wrong product. A refund can only be made if the product is returned back to us, so please contact us to arrange sending it back to our store.

###Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless DrinkIn, its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, partner stores, and suppliers (collectively the "Service Providers") from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation of these terms and conditions or any activity related to your account (including negligent or wrongful conduct) by you or any other person accessing the site using your Internet account.

###Modifications
DrinkIn may revise these terms of use for its web site at any time without notice. By using this web site you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these Terms and Conditions of Use.
